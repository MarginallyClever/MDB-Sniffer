MDB Parser
==========

Update
---
You are welcome to contact me about this project but I won't be moving forward on it.  I was ripped off by the company that promised to sell my vending machine on consignment; I no longer have access to the hardware.  I have moved on to bigger and better things.  Getting me a machine and some testing hardware will not be enough - no two VM makers follow the MDB protocol the same way, the edge cases are painful.  Good luck with your project!

What 
----

Modern vending machines voluntarily adhere to the NAMA standard for Multidrop Bus (MDB).  If these steps are correctly duplicated then this will output to  the Arduino serial window a human-readable interpretation of the conversation taking place inside the vending machine between the various peripherals and the VMC.

Why
---

Many people want to create devices that "speak" MDB and can interact with a vending machine.  Some examples include adding an RFID reader, Accepting payment with BitCoin, touch screens, and discount for secret knock.

How
---

This code is meant to be Arduino firmware.  It assumes that the vending machine components adhere to the [MDB 4.2 standard](http://www.coin-acceptor.com.cn/Upload/EditorFiles/technicalfile/Mdb_version_4-2.pdf).  There are three required components:

* A physical circuit you will have to build/source.  Section 4.4 of the standard describe the circuit.  [An example schematic from the Nottingham Hackspace Wiki](http://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/images/a/a2/VMC-Nanode_Schematic.png) has been included in this distro.
* Arduino #1 runs "near_MDB" firmware.  A1 connects to the physical circuit through the hardware serial.  This means the hardware serial is not avilable to output data to a PC.
* Arduino #2 runs "near_PC" firmware.  A2 connects to your PC through a USB cable.  A2 pin 10 connects to A1 pin 11.  A2 pin 11 connects to A1 pin 10.

Don't forget the common ground between A1 and A2.
